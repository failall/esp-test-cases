# Test-Cases
A few test-cases that captured the problems in my code and helped me fix them.

## USE THESE TEST-CASES AT YOUR OWN RISK! I CANNOT GUARANTUE THE CORRECTNES, ALTHOUGH I DID THE BEST I COULD 

### How-To:
Drop the files from the folders into their respective folders in your cloned repository on your machine.
Copy the contents of tests.toml and paste(append) them to your tests.toml in your repo.

Due to me not knowing the distribution rights of the public testcases/files, I do not want to upload the public testcases of the
professors/tutors.
